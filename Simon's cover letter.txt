Hello, my name is Simon. I am from Moscow.  I am a junior web developer. Right now, I improve my skills in web development 
and more specifically in Vue.js. 

As I see, you looking for a good Senior Frontend Developer, and I hope that you also have a position for me as a Junior Developer. 
Right now I am in process of building a good CV, and I think, your project will help me a lot.
I have basic HTML, CSS, JS, and Gimp skills with an emphasis on Vue.js architecture.

There are some soft skills could be useful for you: 
- I always seek to learn new things and try to find the information I need by myself
- I can handle time management, and always available during working hours  
- I have experience with project management tools like Jira/Trello, and always update my progress and status
- I use a version control system and follow "Keep a Changelog"

Please let me know if you have a position for me or need additional info.
You can contact me by Email: simon.kotov.web@gmail.com

Regards, Simon
